You can change the type of the crosshair by modifying the "labeltext" entry in crosshair.res
Each alphabet letter / symbol represents a different crosshair
Checkout the different options in the TF2Crosshairs.png

Colors can be changed in crosshair_colors.res and crosshair_hitmarker.res

For the rest, just read crosshair_scheme.res and crosshair.res
